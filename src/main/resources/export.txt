    java <javaoptions> export [arguments]

This command exports all classes (except system classes) of a given namespace.
The files will be written in UTF-8.

See:

for a list of global arguments.

Arguments:

    * outputDir=someDir [MANDATORY]

        Tells where the output files should be written. The directory must not
        exist, except if the overwrite option is true.

    * overwrite=<true|false> [OPTIONAL]
