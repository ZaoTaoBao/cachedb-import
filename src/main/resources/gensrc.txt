Syntax:

    java <javaoption> gensrc [arguments]

This command first imports all classes from an XML export into a Cach√© instance,
then exports them as sources in a given directory. It can be viewed as a
combination of both the import and export command.

See:

    java <javaoptions> help

for a list of global arguments.

Arguments:

    * inputFile=the.xml [MANDATORY]

        Path to the XML file to be imported.

    * mode=[file|stream] [OPTIONAL]

        Tells which mode to use to import. The default is file. If file does
        not work for you, try stream.

        Note: if stream is chosen, the list of exported classes is a heuristic.
        First, the list of classes is collected before import, then computed
        again after import. This is due to the fact that the stream mode is
        unable to return a list of imported classes, unlike the file mode.

    * outputDir=someDir [MANDATORY]

        Tells where the output files should be written. The directory must not
        exist, except if the overwrite option is true.

    * overwrite=<true|false> [OPTIONAL]

        Tells what should happen if the directory already exists. The default is
        false.

        If true, the directory will be deleted recursively before being created
        again.
