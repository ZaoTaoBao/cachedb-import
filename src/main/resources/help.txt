GLOBAL ARGUMENTS:

    * cfg=somefile [OPTIONAL]

        Read all subsequent arguments from a file specified by somefile, if any.
        If no such file is found, the program will try and load a file named
        cachedb.properties from the process's working directory.

        This file should be readable as a Java property file. NOTE THAT THE
        EXPECTED ENCODING IS UTF-8, NOT ISO-8859-1 (this is 2016+, afer all).

        Also note that if a property is specified both by this file and on the
        command line, THE SPECIFICATION ON THE COMMAND LINE TAKES PRECEDENCE.

    * verbose=<true|false>

        Augment the verbosity level of the program. The default is false.
