Usage: java -jar thejar -cp cp command [cfg=somefile] [arg1=value1 ...]

COMMAND ARGUMENTS:

    * thejar [MANDATORY]

        Path to the jar; typically, this will be build/libs/cachedb-import.jar.

    * cp [MANDATORY]

        Classpath to both the cachejdbc.jar and cachedb.jar from your Caché
        installation.

    * command [MANDATORY]

        See below.

    * arg1=value1 etc [OPTIONAL]

        Arguments wich are either global to the program or command-specific.

COMMANDS:

    * listClasses: list available classes on a given namespace.

GLOBAL ARGUMENTS:

    * cfg=somefile [OPTIONAL]

        Read arguments from a file specified by somefile, if any. The loading
        order is:

        * if this parameter is specified, further arguments will be loaded from
          this file;
        * if this argument does not exist, or this parameter is not specified,
          the program tries and find a file named cachedb.properties in
          the process's working directory.

        This file should be readable as a Java property file. NOTE THAT THE
        EXPECTED ENCODING IS UTF-8, NOT ISO-8859-1 (this is 2016+, afer all).

        Also note that if a property is specified both by this file and on the
        command line, THE COMMAND LINE TAKES PRECEDENCE.

    * verbose=<true|false> [OPTIONAL]

        Augment the verbosity level of the program. The default is false.

    * host=dbhost [OPTIONAL]

        Specify the host where the Caché installation is hosted. If not
        specified, the default is localhost.

    * port=dbport [OPTIONAL]

        Specify the port to connect to. If not specified, the default is 1972.

    * user=dbuser [MANDATORY]

         Specify the user with which to connect to the database.

    * password=dbpassword [MANDATORY]

        Specify the password for the Caché database user.

    * namespace=somenamespace [MANDATORY]

        Specify the namespace this user must try and connect to.

        Note that the user/password pair must have full access to this
        particular namespace, along with execution privileges on the %SYS
        namespace.
